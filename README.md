## Introduction
Using PyTorch, a leading deep learning library, I've constructed and trained a neural network model to recognize digits from 0 to 9 with impressive accuracy. This project is part of my learning pathway in the Udacity Nanodegree program, specifically focusing on deep learning and neural networks.

Through this project, I've honed my skills in:

🧠 Neural Network Design: Building layers and selecting activation functions.
📊 Data Preprocessing: Handling image data and preparing it for model training.
🤖 PyTorch Utilization: Implementing PyTorch for model construction, training, and testing.
🔍 Model Evaluation: Analyzing the performance of the trained model.
This classifier not only showcases the practical application of neural networks but also serves as a stepping stone in my journey into the expansive field of artificial intelligence.
