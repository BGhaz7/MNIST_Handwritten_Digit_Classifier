## Introduction
Using PyTorch, a leading deep learning library, I've constructed and trained a neural network model to recognize digits from 0 to 9 with impressive accuracy. This project is part of my learning pathway in the [Udacity Nanodegree program](https://www.udacity.com/), specifically focusing on deep learning and neural networks.

Through this project, I've honed my skills in:
- 🧠 **Neural Network Design:** Building layers and selecting activation functions.
- 📊 **Data Preprocessing:** Handling image data and preparing it for model training.
- 🤖 **PyTorch Utilization:** Implementing PyTorch for model construction, training, and testing.
- 🔍 **Model Evaluation:** Analyzing the performance of the trained model.
